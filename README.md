## Alexander Andersson â€” Portfolio

Modern personal site built with Next.js 16 and React 19. The layout focuses on strong first impressions, SEO-friendly server components, and data-driven sections that make it easy to grow the portfolio over time.

### Highlights

- **SSR by default** â€“ all pages use server components for performance and SEO.
- **Section modules** â€“ home sections live in `src/components/sections` with paired `.module.scss`.
- **Project library** â€“ centralised data in `src/data/project.ts`, served through `src/lib/projects.ts`.
- **Scoped styling** â€“ global file only defines tokens + resets; everything else is a CSS Module.
- **Interactive detail pages** â€“ sticky gallery, fade scroll pane, keyboard navigation for screenshots.

### Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19
- TypeScript, SCSS Modules
- ESLint (Next config)

## Content Management

### Projects

1. Add or edit entries in `src/data/project.ts`.
2. If you need screenshots, drop them under `public/images/projects/<slug>/`.
3. Each project can define: `summary`, `tags`, `problem`, `solution`, `highlights`, `results`, `links`, and `screens`.

Home page pulls featured projects via `getFeaturedProjects()`, while `/projects` renders the full list.

### Hero, Skills & Contact

All homepage copy and nav links live in `src/data/profile.ts`.

- Update hero headline/CTA via `heroContent`.
- Tweak nav items with `navLinks`.
- Maintain skills cards with `skills`.
- Contact links power the call-to-action buttons in the footer section.
