## Hi, I’m Alexander Andersson

I’m a software engineering student who builds thoughtful, user-focused products. This portfolio highlights the projects, experiments, and engineering skills that best describe how I approach problem solving and ship production-ready software.

- Currently studying software engineering while freelancing on the side.
- Focused on TypeScript, Next.js, resilient APIs, and polished UX.
- Always open to networking, internships, collaborations, or mentoring chats.

Take a tour of the live site (once deployed) to browse featured work, detailed case studies, and my current capabilities.
